Skype now asks the user to confirm the call instead of initiating the call automatically right away. Of course your baby can't confirm the call, meaning the feature had to be disabled.</p></div><div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 1:</span> Wi-Fi or Bluetooth</h3>	<p>BabyPhone can connect with other devices running BabyPhone over Wi-Fi or over Bluetooth. As long as the devices have the same networking protocols enabled, they should show up in each others list automatically.</p></div>	<div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 2:</span> Lullaby</h3>	<p>When connected, the Lullaby-button can be used to start playing music on the baby's side. If there is no connection, the lullaby starts playing locally.</p></div>	<div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 3:</span> Talk to your Baby</h3>	<p>By enabling your microphone, you can talk to your baby. Let them know you aren't far away!</p></div><div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 4:</span> Always Accept</h3>	<p>If you enable the Always Accept Monitoring Requests setting, you can easily reconnect with the device in the baby room in case the connection got lost.</p></div><div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 5:</span> Warn on Disconnect</h3>	<p>The Disconnect warning will only show on the parent side. It is helpful in cases were you don't notice the dropped connection yourself.</p></div><div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 6:</span> Power Adapter</h3>	<p>Use the power adapter that Apple provided with your iPhone to ensure the battery won't run out whilst you are using BabyPhone.</p></div>	<div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 7:</span> Call forwarding</h3>	<p>In Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Call Forwarding you can forward incoming calls to another phone number. This way your baby won't be woken up by your incoming phone calls.</p></div>	<div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 8:</span> Phone Calls</h3>	<p>If you use the phone call feature, be aware that after each call you will have to restart BabyPhone on your device. Also, in order to be able to initiate phone calls BabyPhone cannot let your device go idle. You can preserve some battery life by setting a low screen brightness.</p></div><div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 9:</span> Sound Sensitivity</h3>	<p>You can change how sensitive BabyPhone is to sound using the slider once you started monitoring using a phone number. If the sound is above the threshold you set for 3 seconds, the phone call will be initiated. You will see a progress bar indicating how much time has elapsed.</p></div><div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Tip 10:</span> Troubleshooting</h3>	<p>If you have troubles connecting to other peers, the easiest solution is often to quit and relaunch BabyPhone.</p></div><div class="block">	<h3><span class="tip">Support:</span> Need more help?
