### What is the UDID?
Each iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad (iOS device) has a Unique Device Identifier (UDID), which is a sequence of 40 letters and numbers that is specific to your device. It’s like a serial number but much harder to guess. It will look something like this: 25e9f90e21f011eb987059f7f4e5f9831d3e2653.

### Why do we need the UDID?
Your iOS device can only install programs that are approved by Apple. Applications in the App Store have been approved by Apple for general distribution, but beta-testers get to try the app before it’s in the store. We register your UDID with Apple so they can approve our application especially for your iOS device.

### How do I get my UDID?

1. Launch iTunes and connect your iOS device.

2. Select your iOS device.

3. In the right pane, locate the information about your device, including its name, capacity, software version, serial number, etc. 

4. Reveal the Identifier by clicking on Serial Number. 

5. Copy the Identifier to your clipboard by choosing Edit → Copy. 

6. Paste the Identifier into an email to your contact at Koolistov. You should be able to paste into your mail program or web browser by selecting Edit → Paste. 

7. Optional: Although not essential, it can be very helpful to also include the device model (iPhone 4S, iPad 2, etc.) and software version (iOS 4.3.5, iOS 5.0, etc.) in the email.
