# Welcome to Koolistov!

{% pullquote %}
_Koolistov loves Apple. {"There. It has been said. Why deny it?!"} The Mac, the iPhone, the iPad, they are all a joy to use. And there is only one reason why this is so: pure passion. Being passionate about getting every detail right is what makes products shine. Getting everything right through hard work is what makes a product feel to 'magically' just work!_

The goal of Koolistov is to bring this same passion and make it visible in the apps that are developed here, whether its yours or our own: it should shine!

## About me
Koolistov was founded by me, Johan Kool, in 2008, although I have been programming with Cocoa for many years before that. 

Koolistov is based in Singapore. But don't let geography be a border to you. I have worked with clients from various countries around the world successfully and to their satisfaction through the wonders of the internet.
