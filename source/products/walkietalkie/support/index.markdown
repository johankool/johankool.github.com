<a class="button" href="/products/walkietalkie/">General Info about Walkie Talkie</a>

**NOTE:** This product has been discontinued.

### How to connect a microphone?
Some older iPod touches don't have a microphone build in. You can still use Walkie Talkie by connecting a microphone to it. One possibility is to use the headphones that come with the iPhone, alternatively you could use a headset such as [this one](http://www.SeaDogBoatingSolutions.com/Avail_Prod_dir/Sea_Dog_Headset.html).

### How does Walkie Talkie connect to other iPhones or iPod touches?
Walkie Talkie uses bluetooth or wifi for the connection between devices. You need to have at least bluetooth enabled, or have a connection to a wifi network. Connecting over the cellular network is not supported.

### What is the range of Walkie Talkie?
The range in which you can use Walkie Talkie depends on how the two devices are connected to each other. When using bluetooth it is in the range of tens of meters. When using wi-fi, it depends on the range of the wifi network used, typical is a range of around 100 meters.

### Is Walkie Talkie a real walkietalkie?
You will not be able to use Walkie Talkie to talk or listen to people using actual radio-based walkietalkies. You can only connect to other users also currently running Walkie Talkie on their iPhone or iPod touch.

### What if I don't see the other device(s) appear?
If you have troubles connecting to other peers, the easiest solution is often to quit and relaunch Walkie Talkie. Do give the app some time to find the other devices before relaunching.
