**NOTE:** This product will be discontinued by the end of this year.

### Why do I have to restart BabyPhone after placing a call?
When BabyPhone places the phone call to warn you, the iPhone quits the app. The iPhone does not relaunch it automatically after the call ends. This is a known current limitation of the iPhone. Unfortunately this means that after each call you will need to restart BabyPhone manually.

I continue to look for a workaround for this issue.

### What happened to calling via Skype?
Unfortunately Skype added a 'security' feature that made it impossible to continue using Skype from BabyPhone. Skype now asks the user to confirm the call instead of initiating the call automatically right away. Of course your baby can't confirm the call, meaning the feature had to be disabled.

### How does BabyPhone connect with other devices?
BabyPhone can connect with other devices running BabyPhone over Wi-Fi or over Bluetooth. As long as the devices have the same networking protocols enabled, they should show up in each others list automatically.

### How can I play the lullaby?
When connected, the Lullaby-button can be used to remotely start playing music on the baby's side. If there is no connection, the lullaby starts playing locally. In the preferences you can choose between two different lullabies.

### How do I talk to my baby?
By enabling your microphone, you can talk to your baby. Let them know you aren't far away!

### What if the connection is frequently lost?
If you enable the Always Accept Monitoring Requests setting, you can easily reconnect with the device in the baby room in case the connection got lost.

### What if I don't notice the disconnection?
In the preference you can enable a warning sound to play in the event the connection is lost. The disconnect warning will only show and sound on the parent side. It is helpful in cases where you didn't notice the dropped connection yourself.

### What if the iPhones battery runs out?
Use the power adapter that Apple provided with your iPhone to ensure the battery won't run out whilst you are using BabyPhone

### How can I prevent incoming phone calls to wake up the baby?
Use the Call Forwarding feature of your iPhone to redirect incoming phone calls. In Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Call Forwarding you can forward incoming calls to another phone number. This way your baby won't be woken up by your incoming phone calls.

### Why does the screen keeps lit?
If you use the phone call feature, be aware that after each call you will have to restart BabyPhone on your device. Also, in order to be able to initiate phone calls BabyPhone cannot let your device go idle. You can preserve some battery life by setting a low screen brightness.

### When is the phone call triggered?
You can change how sensitive BabyPhone is to sound using the slider once you started monitoring using a phone number. If the sound is above the threshold you set for 3 seconds, the phone call will be initiated. You will see a progress bar indicating how much time has elapsed.

### What if I don't see the other device(s) appear?
If you have troubles connecting to other peers, the easiest solution is often to quit and relaunch BabyPhone. Do give the app some time to find the other devices before relaunching.
