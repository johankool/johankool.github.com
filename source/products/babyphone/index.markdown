**NOTE:** This product will be discontinued by the end of this year.

## Hear your baby sleeping…
By connecting two iPhones (or iPod touches) over wifi or bluetooth (it's all automatic!) you can hear exactly what is going on in the baby room. Don't have two iPhones? No problem! You can also let BabyPhone call you automatically on any phone number when your baby cries.

## Rock-a-bye baby…
Two soothing lullabies are included to help your baby fall asleep. You can set the duration and the music will smoothly fade away once the time has passed. In the mean time a diorama plays on screen that kids just love.

## Remote control
Did your baby wake up? You can comfort her by talking to her directly. Or you can start playing the lullaby remotely!
