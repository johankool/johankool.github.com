Lately there has been some controversy regarding GoDaddy, and their support for SOPA. December 29th was set as a protest day to show our discontent with GoDaddy by moving away our domains on that day.

It felt a little too risky to do this while I was traveling, so I only got around to it last week. Anyway, I am glad that I finally got around to moving away my 3 domains, as I had been wanting to do this ever since I heard about GoDaddy's CEO's elephant hunting hobby. (Seriously, what's wrong with this guy?!)

I am ashamed it took me this long to walk way from GoDaddy, so I do this as my public walk of shame.

### Naked domain
Another thing I finally got around to was to have this website's URL drop the 'www'. From now one is it just the naked domain: 'koolistov.net'. This website is now hosted via GitHub and no longer via Google App Engine. The combination GitHub and Octopress is certainly a more pleasant one.
