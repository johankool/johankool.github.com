Stackoverflow lately has been overflowing with dumb questions. Painfully dumb questions. Don't get me wrong. Stackoverflow is still a great, if not the best, place to find and get answers on your programming questions. I find it an indispensable tool in my development workkit. In the past I would spent some of my time there just for the fun of it. Not anymore.

There is an old adage that says: "There is no such thing as a dumb question." Well, I beg to differ. There is plenty proof of its existence on Stackoverflow. There are questions with such poor English that it is barely clear what is being asked. 


And the voting system in place doesn't do a good enough job to keep them out.
