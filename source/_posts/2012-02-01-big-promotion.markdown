For those travelers who stop by Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, there is a big billboard promoting the [RTLNieuws 365 app](http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/rtlnieuws-365/id486518266?mt=8) which I talked about [in my previous post](/blog/2012/01/19/rtlnieuws-365-is-a-go/). 

I have to say that it is quite satisfying to see ones work promoted on a 7 by 8 meters large display. Though not quite as satisfying as it topping the free iPad apps list in the Dutch App Store for a full fortnight already!
