It is the day after the day a new iPad was announced. As always, before the announcement of what the new iPad was really going to be, rumors and speculation ran high. Way high.

Some rumors were correct: Retina Display. Some rumors were off: touch feedback. Nevertheless, afterwards (and this time, heck why not, already before) many articles appeared all over the internet claiming disappointment with what the new iPad offers.

There is something important overlooked though: the satisfaction of existing iPad users. Apple wants to woo in new customers, but it also wants to keep existing customers satisfied. {"A satisfied customer is one that comes back to buy again."} And one of the surest way to piss off a customer? Coming out with a new much improved model shortly after they bought theirs. Sure, this still happens, but Apple makes sure that the improvement is such that an existing user can justify either way to buy or not buy the new model. Users of models that are two generations older have a much harder timer resisting the new model. But theirs is by then almost 2 years old, a ripe old age for any tech gadget.

So the reason for the disappointment amongst the tech journalists covering the new iPad comes from the fact that Apple doses the improvements well. Unlike regular iPad users, they have to upgrade, because it is their job to cover the latest and greatest. The regular users however can chose either way and still feel satisfied with their choice. They'll keep liking their current iPad, or they'll fall in love with their new iPad.

This pattern is also clearly playing out for the iPhone. For iPhone 4 users the iPhone 4S looks like a nice upgrade, for owners of the iPhone 3GS and older models it is pretty much irresistible.

That's all there is to it.
