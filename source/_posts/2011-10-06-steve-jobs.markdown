It is a sad sad day today. We all knew it was coming. We all knew it was coming sooner than we were praying for. Steve Jobs' passing away is still a painful stab in the heart. He was crazy enough to think he could change the world, and damn it, did he ever!

It must have been somewhere around 1991 that I for the first time got to play with a Macintosh. What got me right away was the passion that so obviously had been put into building it, into making it a joy to use, easy to use. It was not about typing 'magic' commands at a blinking cursor, it was about getting things done, and having a good time doing so too!

Today I am typing this on an iMac with possibilities I could not dream of in 1991. Yet it dwarfs the potential of the iPhone and iPad on my desk. Today is the future. And he is the one who made it all possible!

It is a dream come true for me that today I earn my living developing for Mac and iOS. And it is all made possible by the drive of Steve for the very best. He did not do it all by himself, not even close, but he did manage to motivate and push many, many talented people to reach beyond what they could imagine achievable.

I have not met him or worked with him. I have only seen his work from the sideline. But yet, it feels like he was my motivator too. To tell me good is not good enough, to always aim higher. I like to think some of his passion rubbed off on me.

It is a sad sad day today. Coping with the mourning is though. Humor is one of the few mechanism we have to deal with it, so I'll end this with a lighter note:

> Blessed are those who die after Steve Jobs for them awaits the perfect heaven. He is rethinking the whole concept with God at this moment.

Thank you Steve! You are missed.
