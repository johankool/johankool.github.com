    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the perks of having a newborn in the house, besides dirty diapers and frequent feedings, is that you only get up-to-date on some news later than normal. During the last weeks I had been hearing about Windows 8 and the new Metro style apps Microsoft introduced, but it wasn&rsquo;t until this morning that I found some time to look at one of the introduction videos.</p>

<p>Actually, I have to congratulate Microsoft on this one. Like mine (yes, not a subjective opinion, but who cares) theirs is a pretty baby too! A fresh and unique approach is something we don&rsquo;t often see coming out of Redmond. The tiles, the side-by-side mode, sharing between apps are all great features to have. Also smaller things like being able to swipe between pages whilst dragging is a fun new gesture.</p>

<h3>Apple, er&hellip; Window Push Notifications</h3>

<p>But back to Metro, because on touch devices it looks rather promising. I had a good chuckle when they started talking about push notifications. They call this service &ldquo;Windows Push Notifications Service&rdquo;, abbreviated as &ldquo;WNS&rdquo;, I guess abbreviating it as &ldquo;WPNS&rdquo; was to close to &ldquo;APNS&rdquo; as Apple&rsquo;s push notification service is known. These days having push notifications in your OS is definitely a must. It took Apple until iOS 5 before it finally introduced a notification center. I don&rsquo;t think I break any NDA rules if I say that I really love having this feature on my iPhone. Microsoft has decided otherwise: &ldquo;That,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;is not a notification center, but a junk drawer. All those notifications pile up there, and you have to go clean them up or eventually your drawer will overflow with junk.&rdquo; I wonder how long it will take them to make a full 180 and eat their words on this.</p>

<h3>Competition Welcome</h3>

<p>Although there is a lot of new stuff, it is evident Microsoft took a good look at Apple&rsquo;s iOS. I don&rsquo;t doubt the reverse will happen too, and would welcome side-by-side apps in iOS 6. Also the sharing services are great additions and a good feature to have in a mobile OS. It is good that Apple is facing some more competition here now. Until now competition was not too impressive: Android is still playing catchup, WebOS is being kicked around by CEOs and Blackberry&hellip; not sure why I even mention them.</p>
